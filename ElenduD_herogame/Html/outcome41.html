          You continue to sit down. You see one of the hostages trying to pull a fast one. He, but he is just too slow. He trys to do a karate move on one of the guards and fails misrably. He is met with on of the worst beatdowns you ever seen. The two guards stomp mudholes in his chest untill his is nothing,but a puddle of blood and regret. He got wasted. You notice how slow it took the robbers to react to him. You are much faster and quicker than the guy who tried. You get filled with regret, guilt, and shame.
